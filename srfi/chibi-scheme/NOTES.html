<h1>Chibi implementation</h1>

<p>
There are two implementations of this SRFI, <a href="https://scsh.net/">Scsh</a> version 0.7,
<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">which can be found at GitHub in the scsh repository of scheme</a>,
and a Chibi Scheme <code>(srfi 170)</code> library.  You can find the Chibi Scheme example implementation,
and build notes for scsh, in their own <code>srfi</code> subdirectories.
</p>
<p>
This file documents the current exceptions and deviations
of the Chibi Scheme implementation.
</p>
<p>
Note generally that the Chibi implementation is completely thread-naive.
What is more, the implementation's FDOs don't interoperate with
those used by Chibi natively, which may cause some issues mixing
SRFI 170 operations with native Chibi ones.  In particular, make sure to
hold on to any port on which <code>port-internal-fdo</code> was
called, so that the garbage collector does not close the file descriptor.
</p>

<h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Error handling</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Chibi Scheme implementation's setting and getting of errno are
done at the Scheme level, and arbitrary Chibi Scheme code that might
change errno can run between SRFI 170 setting, setting by a system or
library call due to an error, and SRFI 170 getting the current errno.
</ul>

<h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The Chibi Scheme versions of the <code>fd->*port</code> procedures
do not support the <i>buffer-mode</i> argument.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File system</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The Chibi Scheme implementation of <code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> is
neither finished or exported.
</li></p>
</ul>
