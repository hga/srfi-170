Add a Makefile target to run the REPL with the module loaded.

Adjust README.md to describe all this.


Needed to match the SRFI:

Add optional buffer-mode argument to fdes->[textual|binary]-[input|output]-port

Finish call-with-temporary-filename


Suggested enhancements:

Make appropriate procedures thread safe or thread aware

Improve temp-file-prefix specification and perhaps implementation

Use [...]at functions to handle long file paths.

See (chibi io) for how to write a C function then wrap it in a stub

WRT to above, in general, a great deal of cleanup can be done, this
project was my (hga's) reintrodution to using Scheme in anger after
many decades, and my introduction to Chibi Scheme and its extremely
nifty autogenerating FFI (170.stub) and raw FFI (aux.c).
